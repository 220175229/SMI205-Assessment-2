# SMI205-Assessment-2
This project is the replication of the paper: 'What causes COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy? Ignorance and the lack of bliss in the United Kingdom.' and it was conducted by J Bullock, J.E Lane, & F.L Shults in 2022.

It is about vaccination hesitancy and knowledge in the COVID-19 pandemic. These both became increasingly prominent problems for all governments around the world due to Anti-vaxxer movements affecting the need to protect vulnerable populations. They aim to investigate what made people more or less likely to take vaccinations, with a focus on social media. I have chosen to add to this by adding in the varibale of age.
